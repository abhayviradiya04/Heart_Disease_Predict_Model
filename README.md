## ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Model

A web application built with **FastAPI** that predicts the risk of heart disease using a trained machine learning model. 
Users can input clinical data, and the system returns predictions with high accuracy.​

✨ Features
🧑‍⚕️ **User-Friendly Interface:** Allows users to input clinical data such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.

🤖 **Machine Learning Integration:** Utilizes a pre-trained model to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

🔄 **Data Preprocessing:** Includes feature scaling and preparation for accurate model predictions.

🖼️ **Templates:** Implements Jinja2 templates for dynamic HTML pages like forms and result displays.

🔌 **Scalable APIs:** API endpoints designed for seamless communication between front-end and back-end.​

#### 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- 🐍 **Python**: Programming language for backend development  
- ⚡ **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework for APIs
