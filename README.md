❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Model
A web application built with FastAPI that predicts the risk of heart disease using a trained machine learning model. Users can input clinical data, and the system returns predictions with high accuracy.​

✨ Features
🧑‍⚕️ User-Friendly Interface: Allows users to input clinical data such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.

🤖 Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes a pre-trained model to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

🔄 Data Preprocessing: Includes feature scaling and preparation for accurate model predictions.

🖼️ Templates: Implements Jinja2 templates for dynamic HTML pages like forms and result displays.

🔌 Scalable APIs: API endpoints designed for seamless communication between front-end and back-end.​

🛠️ Technologies Used
​

FastAPI: Back-end framework for handling requests and responses.

Scikit-learn: For training and using the machine learning model.

Pandas: For data manipulation and input preparation.

Jinja2: For dynamic HTML rendering.

Joblib: For efficient model and scaler serialization.​
